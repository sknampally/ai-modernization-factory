"""Engineering Knowledge Catalog loading services.

Curated catalog documents are versioned seed data. They become an
``EngineeringKnowledgeGraph`` only after safe parse, typed property validation,
duplicate checks, and domain schema validation. Loading is deterministic and
does not evaluate rule expressions or technology lifecycle dates.
