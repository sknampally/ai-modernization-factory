        "risk reduction order, not arbitrary partitions of IDs. Phase "

        "static-analysis profile used.\n"

        "- Synthesize related evidence into broader modernization initiatives.\n"
        "- Each AI recommendation should normally combine multiple related "

        "strengthen automated-test reliability; standardize logging and "

        "initiative where appropriate.\n"

        "risk, and operational impact over isolated style violations.\n"
